Fractal's Latest Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Introduction
==============

Welcome to The Fractal Documentation, where you can find information and guides to help you learn about Fractal and start exploring its features.   

Fractal is dedicated to providing a high performance and energy-efficient blockchain platform, and supporting a wide variety of decentralized applications. The Fractal Blockchain helps you write commercial-scale dApps, it provides secure scalability solutions to handle serveral thousands transactions with near-instant finality.

Why Fractal Platform
-------------------------------------------------
* **Built-in Security**

	Fractal is powered by iChing, a Bitcoin-like proof-of-stake consensus protocol with rigorous security proof and post-quantum guarantee.   

* **Decentralized**

	Fractal enables large-scale networks with millions of miners, and it's nearly free for new miner to join in.  

* **Energy-efficient**

  	Proof-of-stake uses much less energy for mining than proof-of-work, thus, miner doesn't need to hire expensive machines, finally, it will be much cheaper for dApp providers and users on Fractal Platform.  

* **Scalability**

  	Fractal imports network acceleration layer for transaction pack and broadcast, and can process serveral thousands transactions per second.  

* **Smart Contract Support**

  	Fractal embraces WebAssembly for smart contract, since it's much easier to develop and faster to run.
